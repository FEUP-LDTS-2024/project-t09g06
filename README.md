# Self Evaluation

To streamline our collaborative work on the Gauntlet-like game, we divided the responsibilities among team members to optimize efficiency and leverage individual strengths in specific areas of the project. Each student focused on a particular group of features, contributing their skills to ensure a balanced distribution of tasks: Classes and Controllers, Viewer Classes and GUI, Tests and Otimization.

    André Gomes: 33.3%
    Tiago Carvalho: 33.3%
    Vasco Alves: 33.3%

This approach allowed each team member to specialize, enhancing productivity and cohesion throughout the development process.
